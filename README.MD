## The problem it solves ##
The culture of Competitive Programming has been growing at an exponential scale in India as well as around the world.\
The current Competitive Programming platforms such as Codeforces, Codechef have a limitation of not being able to handle high loads on their servers i.e, max out at handling around 20000-30000 submissions simultaneously.\
There are several consequences of this problem:\
1. Many of the contests go unrated 
2. Participants have to wait for several minutes for their submissions to be evaluated.
3. Due to high load on the queue, the website goes slow.\

All these problems degrade the experience and thrill of a competitive programming contest.
